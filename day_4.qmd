## Goals for Today

- Understand how to make a variety of basic plots (scatter and bar)
- Manipulate data (relabeling)
- Export graphs

# Data for Today 

Today we are going to keep using a subset of country data from [The Quality of Governance Institute](https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government/qog-data).

- Download the [data we'll be using here](images/country_data.csv)
- You can open it with `read_csv()` and if you need more help check out the [first day of slides.](day_1.qmd)
- There is a description of all the [variables I've included here.](https://kevinreuning.com/presentations/pages/country_data.html) 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
setwd("images")
df <- read_csv("country_data.csv")
```


# Smooths and Grouping

## Showing a trend

`geom_smooth()` can be used to add a trend line to our data. 

```{r}
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=vdem_academ, y=mad_gdppc,color=fh_polity2)) + 
    geom_point(size=3) 
p + geom_smooth()
```

## Dangers of `geom_smooth()`

`geom_smooth()` is very powerful, but it is easy to have no idea what you are doing with it as defining `trend` is really hard. 

You change the type of trend it makes using the `method=` argument

## Different Smooths - Linear

```{r}
# Linear regression is "lm"
p + geom_smooth(method="lm") 
```

## Different Smooths - Loess line

```{r}
# A local regression line is "loess"
p + geom_smooth(method="loess") 
```

## Different Smooths - Spline

```{r}
# A spline is "gam"
p + geom_smooth(method="gam") 
```

---



::: {.callout-warning}
If you cannot explain what is happening to make that line then you should probably avoid using it. 
:::

## Multiple Smooths

If we have multiple types of observations, we can plot smooths for each one by setting `group=` to that variable. 


```{.r}
df <- df %>% mutate(
    fert_groups = cut(wdi_fertility, breaks=c(0, 1.8, 2.4, Inf), 
            labels=c("Below", "Replacement", "Above"))
            ) %>%
    group_by(fert_groups) %>% drop_na(fert_groups)
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=vdem_academ, y=mad_gdppc,color=fh_polity2)) + 
    geom_point(size=3) 
p + geom_smooth(aes(group=fert_groups))
```
::: {.callout-note}
You can use `aes()` in a `geom_*()` if you want to specify something for just that part of the plot.
:::

## Multiple Smooths

```{r}
#| echo: false
df <- df %>% mutate(
    fert_groups = cut(wdi_fertility, breaks=c(0, 1.8, 2.4, Inf), 
            labels=c("Below", "Replacement", "Above"))
            ) %>%
    group_by(fert_groups) %>% drop_na(fert_groups)
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=vdem_academ, y=mad_gdppc,color=fh_polity2)) + 
    geom_point(size=3) 
p + geom_smooth(aes(group=fert_groups))
```



## Multiple Smooths Improved

```{r}
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=vdem_academ, y=mad_gdppc,  group=fert_groups, color=fert_groups)) + 
    geom_point(size=3) 
p + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

# Facets

## Introduction

Sometimes it is easier to understand the groups if you create individual plots for each group. We call these plots facet and make them with `facet_wrap()` 

To identify what groups to make you put `~variable`. 

## Example

```{r}
# using plot from previous one still. 
p + geom_smooth(method="lm") +
    facet_wrap(~fert_groups)
```

## Check 

Pick two interval variables, and an additional variable (any type). Make a scatter plot of the variables using the third variable to color in the points. 

Add a smooth, and facet on a variable as well. 

Don't forget labels. 


# Everything together

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
#| output-location: slide
df %>% 
    mutate(type = cut(fh_polity2,  breaks=c(0, 3, 7, 10), 
                        labels=c("Autocracy", "Anocracy", "Democracy"))) %>% 
    drop_na(type) %>%  
    ggplot(aes(y=wdi_afp, x=mad_gdppc)) + 
    geom_smooth(method="lm", color='black') + 
    geom_point(color='orangered3') + 
    facet_wrap(~type) + 
    scale_x_log10(labels=scales::label_dollar()) +
    theme_minimal() + theme(strip.text=element_text(size=20)) + 
    labs(y="Percent of Labor\nForce in Military", 
    x="GDP per Capita\n(Log scale)") 
```

# Principles of Better Graphics

## General principles: Less is usually more

Less is usually more

-   Plots don't need to have a lot of bells and whistle.
-   You are should direct attention to what is important.
-   At the same time\...
    -   Everything should have a label
    -   You can use grid lines to highlight (relevant differences

## General principles: Follow assumptions

People have assumptions about how plots work, don't break them unless you make it **very** clear that you are.


![](images/gun_violence.jpg){fig-align="center"}


## Some Assumptions

Some assumptions people make: 

- If one of the variables is time, it usually is on the x-axis.
- The further you are from the bottom left the higher the number.
- The axis are continuous (and often linear)

## Example - Breaking Assumptions

## Example - Following Assumptions

General principles: Follow assumptions

![](images/flipped_2.png){fig-align="center"}

## General principles: Make it clear

Make it clear to the viewer what they are supposed to take away from it.

- If they should look at trends, add a trend line
- If they are making comparisons across groups put those groups together

## Example: Making it Unclear

## Longer Example - Local Party Social Media

\normalsize 
- Interested in how local parties in the US use social media.
- Collected social media info for Â 6,000 local parties.
- Used Crowdtangle to download all their facebook posts from 2016 to 2021.
- Dataset contained 3,907,203 posts with 26 variables per post.

## Social Media Data

Social media data can be very interesting:

- We have the text of the posts.
- We have the reactions to the post (number of likes, comments shares)
- We have the *exact* time the post was made.

## Looking at Trends

Always good to look at trends in data: 
-  Calculate daily number of posts.
-  Calculate the average number of reactions per post per day.


## Some of the code

```{.r}
p1 <- ggplot(tmp, aes(x=lubridate, y=N, fill=Party, 
    color=Party, shape=Party)) + 
    geom_point(alpha=.2) + geom_smooth(size=1,method = loess,
    method.args=list("span" =.5)) + 
    theme_minimal() + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) + 
    scale_color_manual("Party",
    values=col_pal)  + 
    scale_fill_manual(values=col_pal) + 
    # geom_vline(xintercept = lubridate::as_date("2020-11-03"), linetype="dashed") + 
    labs(y="Number of Posts", x="")
```

# Quarto 

## One Document to Rule them All

With Quarto we can do our analysis, write-up the results, and present plots all in a single document. 

This has a few benefits:

- We can easily update the analysis in our final report. 
- You can export the report to a variety of document types. 
- It makes it easy to show how you did what you did. 

Note: This entire presentation is written in Quarto and available here. 

## Creating a Quarto Document 

In RStudio go to File $\rightarrow$ New File $\rightarrow$ Quarto Document. You can change the Title and then click **Create**

![](images/Day_4_Quarto.png){fig-align="center"}


## Lay of the Land

There are two ways to edit Quarto files:

- Source: Shows the underlying code. 
- Visual: A modified version of the code that shows what it looks like. 

When you want to see your final document click the  **Render** button with the blue arrow. 

Click it now (it will ask you to save the file, save it where your country data is located). 

## Render Document 

When you Render a document Quarto does a few things:

- It runs the R Code in the blocks. 
- It formats everything in the way you've indicated. 
- It converts it to the final document type (for us an HTML page). 

## Editing Quarto 

Switch to the **Source** version of the document (the button near the top). 

You should see something like:

````` markdown
---
title: "Country Report"
format: html
editor: visual
---

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{{r}}
1 + 1
```

`````

## What is Going On?

:::


## Lets Make a Document

What do we want to do? 

- We have a plot we made already, lets put that into our Quarto document
- Lets add background information about the data as well and a description of what we find. 

## Code Execution 

Whenever we want to execute code in a Quarto document we surround it with:

```` markdown
```{{r}}
## Run Code Here
```
````

Our code needs to execute without having anything saved, so we need to include both opening the data _and_ making the plot. 

## Opening our Data

If the Quarto document add the code to open the file, remember to load the necessary package as well (if you saved everything in the same folder you don't need to worry about the working directory).

Call the `data` object by itself afterwards as a check, and then render the whole thing. 

. . .

```` markdown
```{{r}}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("country_data.csv")
data
```
````

## Hiding Stuff

We can modify how the code is executed by adding options at the top of the chunk using `#|`

- Do we want to see the code or not? set with `echo: true` or `echo: false`
- Do we want to see the output for the code or not? set with `output: true` or `output: false`

```` markdown
```{{r}}
#| echo: false
#| output: false 
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("country_data.csv")
data
```
````

Render the document again to see what happens now. 

## Making a Plot 

Now we want to make our plot, we can do that in a new code chunk below the old one. 

Create a new code chunk, and copy and paste the plot you made before to it:

```` markdown
```{{r}}
ggplot(data, aes( .... )) + ...
```
````

You can again, either hide the code using `#| echo: false` but don't change the output. 

## Providing a Description 

Above the plot, I want you to write a description of the data. You can get that [info here](https://kevinreuning.com/presentations/pages/country_data.html). Make it clear what each variable represents. 

If you want to break up your writeup you can use headers:

``` markdown 
# Biggest Header
## Second Biggest
### Third Biggest
```

## Accessing Variables Outside of Code

You can also access variables from code in your write-up. So lets say you calculate the mean in a code chunk:

```` markdown 
```{{r}}
mean_gdp <- mean(df$mad_gdppc, na.rm=T)
```
````

In your writeup you can access that by calling ```` markdown `r  knitr::inline_expr('mean_gdp') ````:

```` markdown
```{{r}}
mean_gdp <- mean(df$mad_gdppc, na.rm=T)
```

The average GDP in a country is `r  knitr::inline_expr('mean_gdp')` while the maximum is...

````


## Other Formats

You can make a lot of things in Quarto:

- `format: docx` will produce a docx file
- `format: pptx` will produce a powerpoint with each section as a slide
- `format: pdf` will produce a pdf document.

Some of these will require installation of additional packages.
