# Goals For this Bootcamp 

- Understand basic SNA terminology
- Load a variety of SNA formats into R.
- Calculate some basic network and nodal statistics. 
- Make network visualizations. 
- Know where to look for more. 

## Where We Are Going {.nostretch}

# Goals for Today

- Go over some basic language of social network analysis. 
- Load some SNA data into R.
- Start manipulating that 

# Social Network Concepts

## Nodes/Vertices and Edges

SNA focuses on the relationships between different entities: 

- **Nodes** or **Vertices**: The entities that make-up your network.
    - Ex: individuals, animals, organizations, counties, ...
- **Edges:** The relationships that make-up your network. 
    - Ex: Friendship, proximity, exchange of goods, ...

## Edges - Variation and Types

There are a lot of types of edges. 

# R and SNA

There are two major sets of R libraries used for networking: 


- [igraph](https://igraph.org/): Fewer analysis options, better default plotting, has python and and C versions as well.  
- [statnet](https://statnet.org/): Has a lot of analysis options, the plotting isn't as nice (in my opinion), and a lot of it is divided up into additional libraries. 

## Following along

You need to learn by doing. If you haven't opened RStudio yet, do so now. You should have something like:
