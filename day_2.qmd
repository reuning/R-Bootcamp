## Goals for this Bootcamp 


## Goals for Today

- Manipulate data (filter specific rows, select columns).
- Create summaries of different groups.
- Merging data together
- pipes


# Data for today 

# Filtering Data 

Often you want to select just specific rows of data that meet certain requirements. 



## Logical Checks 

We need to include some more operators to do this:

- `<` less than and `>` greater than
- `<=` less than or equal to and `>=` greater than or equal to 
- `==` equal to and `!=` not equal to

. . .

```{R}
43 < 4
(4*pi)^2 > 5
```

## Logical Values 

- The output from these checks is another form of variable called a **logical**. 
- We can have vectors of logical values

```{R}
names <- c("Kevin", "Anne", "Sophie")
names == "Kevin"
```

## Logical Checks on Data 



## Logical Operators
- We have **and** and **or** operators to check multiple logical values. 
    - **and** is `&`
    - **or** is `|` (shift + backslash)
- `&` returns `TRUE` if both values are `TRUE`
- `|` returns `TRUE` if at least one value is `TRUE`

. . .

```{.R}
TRUE & TRUE 
TRUE | FALSE 
TRUE | TRUE 
```
All would return `TRUE`

## Combining Logical Check

We can then combine logical checks together.

```{R}
val <- pi^(2/3)
(val < 1) | (val > 4) # Is it less than 0 or greater than 4?
```
